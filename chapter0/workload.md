## Amount of Work

Teams have reported up to 20 hours of work each week.  Getting out of the classroom is what the effort is about. If you canâ€™t commit the time to talk to customers, this course is not for you. Teams are expected to have completed at least 10 in-person or Skype video interviews each week, focused in the Business Model Canvas area of emphasis for that week. In the 2nd and 3rd week of class, we expect at least 15 interviews to get up to speed quickly on Customer Segments and Value Proposition.

This means in total over the 7-week course, you will have completed at least 70 interviews. For those with easy to access interview groups, e.g., consumer product/service businesses, more interviews will be expected.
