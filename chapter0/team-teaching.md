## Team Teaching and the Inverted Lecture Hall

Sitting in the back of the classroom are experienced instructors, professionals who’ve built and/or funded world-class startups and have worked with hundreds of entrepreneurial teams. We won’t be "lecturing" in the traditional sense, but commenting on and critiquing each team’s progress. While the comments may be specific to each team, the insights are almost always applicable to all teams. Pay attention.
