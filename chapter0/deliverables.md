## Deliverables

Meaningful Customer Discovery requires the development of a minimum viable product

(MVP). Therefore, each team should have the applicable goal of the following:

1. Teams building a physical product must have a bill of materials and a prototype.

2. Teams building a web product must attempt to build the site, create demand and have customers using it. See:  [http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-lean-launchpad-edition/](http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-lean-launchpad-edition/) .

3. Your team will present a weekly in-course PowerPoint summary of progress.
