## Course Roadmap

Each weekâ€™s class is organized around participants hypothesis-testing their business model assumptions outside the classroom:

* Talking to 10-15 customers.

* Capturing their Customer Discovery progress by using the LaunchPad Central Software ([https://launchpadcentral.com/](https://launchpadcentral.com/) ) and updating their Business Model Canvas.

* Taking what they learned and assembling a 10-minute Lessons Learned Presentation.

* Engaging with their mentors.

* Attending mandatory office hours.

* Watching the Udacity lecture for the week and preparing questions for discussion.

* Receiving comments and suggestions from other teams and the teaching team on the lessons learned.
