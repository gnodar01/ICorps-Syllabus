## Experiential Learning

You will be spending a significant amount of time in between each of the lectures outside the course talking to customers. Each week your team will conduct at least 10 customer interviews focused on a specific part of the Business Model Canvas. This course is a simulation of what startups and entrepreneurship are like in the real world: chaos, uncertainty, impossible deadlines in insufficient time, conflicting input, etc.
