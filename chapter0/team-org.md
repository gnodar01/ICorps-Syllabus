## Team Organization

This course is team-based. Working and studying will be done in teams. You will be admitted as a team.

Team projects can be software, a physical product, or a service of any kind. The teams will self-organize and establish individual roles on their own. There are no formal CEO/VPs. Just the constant parsing and allocating of the tasks that needs to be done.

Besides the instructors and TA, each team will be assigned a mentor (an experienced entrepreneur or VC) to provide assistance and support.
