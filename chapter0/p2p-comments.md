## Peer-to-Peer Comments

While other teams are presenting the results of their weekly experiments, the rest of the teams are expected to attentively listen, engage, and react to what they see and hear. Sharing insights, experience, and contacts with each other is a key way that this unique laboratory achieves results. (And it is a significant part of your grade as well!)
