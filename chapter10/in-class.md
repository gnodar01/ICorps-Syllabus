## In-Class

This 3-hour workshop session is mandatory.

Effective business communication is more than just conveying the facts. It also entails putting the facts in a context and flow that adds to their meaning and puts them in a form that brings the "listener" into the process. The analogy often used is that of a story; that good business communicators are able to combine words, images, and shared contexts (analogies) to crisply convey meaning. This is the art of the great “pitch.”

This session will help prepare you not only for your team’s final presentation in this class, but with life skills that will hopefully benefit you in multiple venues, for many years.
