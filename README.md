## Prerequisite

Passion in discovering how an idea can become a real company.

## Goal

An experiential learning opportunity showing how founders build startups.

# Course Description

This course provides real world, hands-on learning on what it’s like to actually start a company. This course is not about how to write a business plan. It’s not an exercise on how smart you are in a classroom, how well you write code or what your patent is, or how well you use the research library to size markets. And the end result is not a PowerPoint pitch deck for a VC "demo day." And it is most definitely not an incubator where you come to build the “hot idea” that you have in mind.

This is a practical course – essentially a lab, not a theory or "book" course. Our goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create an entrepreneurial experience for you with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage startup. The course is designed to give you the experience of how to work as a team and turn an idea into a company.

You will be getting your hands dirty talking to customers, partners, and competitors, as you encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. You’ll practice evidence-based entrepreneurship as you learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone other than you would want/use your product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback you gathered, you will use agile development to rapidly iterate your product to build something customers would actually use and buy. Each block will be a new adventure outside the classroom as you test each part of your business model and then share the hard-earned knowledge with the rest of the teams.

Make sure you read the Frequently Asked Questions in this document (FAQs)

## The Flipped Classroom

Unlike a traditional classroom where the instructor presents lecture material, our lectures are online at Udacity.com. Watching the assigned lectures is part of your weekly preparations. The information in them is essential for you to complete your weekly interviews and present the insights the teaching team will expect in your presentation for that week. We expect you to watch the assigned lectures for the upcoming week before class and we will use time in class to discuss questions about the lecture material and to provide supplemental material. You need to come prepared with questions or comments about the material for in-class discussion. We will cold-call, question you, about the online lecture material.

## Experiential Learning

You will be spending a significant amount of time in between each of the lectures outside the course talking to customers. Each week your team will conduct at least 10 customer interviews focused on a specific part of the Business Model Canvas. This course is a simulation of what startups and entrepreneurship are like in the real world: chaos, uncertainty, impossible deadlines in insufficient time, conflicting input, etc.

## Team Teaching and the Inverted Lecture Hall

Sitting in the back of the classroom are experienced instructors, professionals who’ve built and/or funded world-class startups and have worked with hundreds of entrepreneurial teams. We won’t be "lecturing" in the traditional sense, but commenting on and critiquing each team’s progress. While the comments may be specific to each team, the insights are almost always applicable to all teams. Pay attention.

## Peer-to-Peer Comments

While other teams are presenting the results of their weekly experiments, the rest of the teams are expected to attentively listen, engage, and react to what they see and hear. Sharing insights, experience, and contacts with each other is a key way that this unique laboratory achieves results. (And it is a significant part of your grade as well!)

## Course Culture

Startups communicate in a dramatically different style from the university or larger culture most of you are familiar with. At times it can feel brusque and impersonal, but in reality it is focused and oriented to create immediate action in time- and cash-constrained environments. We have limited time and we push, challenge, and question you in the hope you will quickly learn. We will be direct, open, and tough – just like the real world. We hope you can recognize that these comments aren’t personal, but part of the process. This approach may seem harsh or abrupt, but it is all part of our wanting you to learn to challenge yourselves quickly and objectively, and to appreciate that as entrepreneurs you need to learn and evolve faster than you ever imagined possible.

This course pushes many people past their comfort zone. If you believe that your role of your instructors is to praise in public and criticize in private, you’re in the wrong course. Do not take this course. 

If you come from a culture where receiving critiques in front of your peers – on a weekly basis – that may feel abrupt and brusque – embarrasses you, do not take this course. It’s not personal, but it is by design a part of the course to emulate the pace, uncertainty, and pressures of a startup. In return, we also expect you to question us, challenge our point of view if you disagree, and engage in a real dialog with the teaching team.

## Amount of Work

Teams have reported up to 20 hours of work each week.  Getting out of the classroom is what the effort is about. If you can’t commit the time to talk to customers, this course is not for you. Teams are expected to have completed at least 10 in-person or Skype video interviews each week, focused in the Business Model Canvas area of emphasis for that week. In the 2nd and 3rd week of class, we expect at least 15 interviews to get up to speed quickly on Customer Segments and Value Proposition.

This means in total over the 7-week course, you will have completed at least 70 interviews. For those with easy to access interview groups, e.g., consumer product/service businesses, more interviews will be expected.

## Team Organization

This course is team-based. Working and studying will be done in teams. You will be admitted as a team.

Team projects can be software, a physical product, or a service of any kind. The teams will self-organize and establish individual roles on their own. There are no formal CEO/VPs. Just the constant parsing and allocating of the tasks that needs to be done.

Besides the instructors and TA, each team will be assigned a mentor (an experienced entrepreneur or VC) to provide assistance and support.

## Pre-Course Preparation

This course hits the ground running. It assumes you and your team have come into course having done the assigned reading and viewing and prepared a set of contacts to call on.

## Deliverables

Meaningful Customer Discovery requires the development of a minimum viable product

(MVP). Therefore, each team should have the applicable goal of the following:

1. Teams building a physical product must have a bill of materials and a prototype.

2. Teams building a web product must attempt to build the site, create demand and have customers using it. See:  [http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-lean-launchpad-edition/](http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-lean-launchpad-edition/) .

3. Your team will present a weekly in-course PowerPoint summary of progress.

## Course Roadmap

Each week’s class is organized around participants hypothesis-testing their business model assumptions outside the classroom:

* Talking to 10-15 customers.

* Capturing their Customer Discovery progress by using the LaunchPad Central Software ([https://launchpadcentral.com/](https://launchpadcentral.com/) ) and updating their Business Model Canvas.

* Taking what they learned and assembling a 10-minute Lessons Learned Presentation.

* Engaging with their mentors.

* Attending mandatory office hours.

* Watching the Udacity lecture for the week and preparing questions for discussion.

* Receiving comments and suggestions from other teams and the teaching team on the lessons learned.

### In the classroom

* Q&A about what happened during the past week’s Discovery.

* Team presentations and instructor critiques.

* Discussion about the online lecture you just watched on one of the nine building blocks of a business model to help prepare you for next week’s Discovery (see diagram below, taken from Business Model Generation

The work you will be presenting will be based on the Udacity lecture you watched the prior week. The lecture you watch just before classes, and the in-class lecture, will cover the upcoming week’s business model topic to prepare you for the discovery tasks for this week. That means we expect you to have watched that lecture prior to the course.

For example, when you arrive for Course 4, where you will be presenting your work on Customer Relationships, you are expected to have just watched the Customer Relationships lecture on Udacity. You should come prepared with any questions or comments about Customer Relations for in-class discussion, (which will occur at the end of the team presentations on Customer Channels).

Each week you are expected to have an updated version of your entire Business Model Canvas, but your Customer Discovery should focus primarily on the topic from the previous class’s lecture and pre-class readings and videos.

## Guidelines for Team Presentations

Each team is expected to speak to at least 10-15 customers every week. The 10-minute weekly team presentations are summaries of the team’s findings during that week.

Each week, you are expected to have an updated version of your entire Business Model Canvas, but your Customer Discovery should focus primarily on the topic listed for the week, which was discussed at the end of previous class. This is true regardless of whether you’ve pivoted and are re-exploring topics from earlier lectures. In the case of a pivot (which can be indicative of successful Customer Discovery), you will have to work doubly hard to cover earlier class topics and touch on current class topics in your weekly presentation. The format for slides will vary week to week, however the general format is this:

### Slide 1: Cover slide

* Team name

    * Team members/roles

* Number of customers spoken to this week

* Three sentence description about what the team does and why your audience should care

* Market Size (TAM – total addressable market, SAM – Serviceable Addressable Market,   TM – Target Market) did it change this week?

    * Exported from LaunchPad Central

### Slide 2: Updated Business Model Canvas 

* Week-to-week changes shown in red (Exported from LaunchPad Central)

* Multi-sided markets shown in different colors

### Slide 3 - What did you learn about

*"topic of the day" (Canvas block x)*

* Hypothesis: Here’s What we Thought

* Experiments: Here’s What we Did

* Results: Here’s What we Found

* Action: Here’s What we Are Going to Do Next

### Slide 4 – Diagram (if appropriate)

* Diagram of what you learned this week (e.g. customer workflow, payment flows, distribution channel diagram)

Feedback from the teaching team during oral presentations is where the most learning occurs. Due to the pace and tempo of the course, all course participants will be held accountable for completing the reading and video materials detailed in the syllabus covering the material for each class.
